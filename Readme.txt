This code presents the prototype for a Medical clinic.  The clinic wanted to be able to input patient data and retrieve patient data.  All the data is stored in an SQL database and there multiple levels of data retrieval possible.  For example, an initial query can provide a list a of patients with a selected diagnosis.  Based on the query results, the user can then drill down into the specific data records for a selected patient.
